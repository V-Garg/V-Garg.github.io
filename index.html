                <h1>Vaibhav Garg</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Vaibhav, a robotics engineer and a computer engineering student at the University of
                    Maryland, College Park. I’m passionate about designing and building complex robotic systems, from
                    SLAM LiDAR robots to custom motor controllers and robotic arms. My work spans ROS, CAD, and embedded
                    C for real-time control and system design.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm focused on creating innovative solutions for robotics and autonomous systems. My
                    journey has led me to work with various robotics teams, where I've developed autopilot systems,
                    implemented custom firmware, and tackled challenging projects like a Computer Vision Catching Robot
                    Arm and a SLAM robot using LiDAR.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy learning from mentors, experimenting with new tech, and contributing to
                    projects that make a difference. I’m driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible in
                    robotics and automation, and I look forward to continuing my journey with a mix of creativity,
                    technical expertise, and humility.</p>
