            <p>Hello! I'm Vaibhav, a robotics engineer and a computer engineering student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I’m passionate about designing and building complex robotic systems, from SLAM LiDAR robots to custom motor controllers and robotic arms. My work spans ROS, CAD, and embedded C for real-time control and system design.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm focused on creating innovative solutions for robotics and autonomous systems. My journey has led me to work with various robotics teams, where I've developed autopilot systems, implemented custom firmware, and tackled challenging projects like a Computer Vision Catching Robot Arm and a SLAM robot using LiDAR.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy learning from mentors, experimenting with new tech, and contributing to projects that make a difference. I’m driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics and automation, and I look forward to continuing my journey with a mix of creativity, technical expertise, and humility.</p>
